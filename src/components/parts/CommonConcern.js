                        <p>Yes, donating blood is safe. You can’t get AIDS or any other infectious disease from giving blood because we always use new, sterile needles that are discarded after one use.
You’ll even be given a mini-physical at your appointment, to ensure you are healthy enough to donate that day. We’ll check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse and hemoglobin.</p>
                        <p className='fw-bold'>I'm Afraid I'll Faint</p>
                        <p>Most donors feel fine after donating blood, but if you do feel faint or fatigued, simply lie down until you feel better. It might help you to think about this: you have about 10 pints of blood in your body. Roughly 1 pint is given during a donation. Your body can replenish that loss in a short time (a matter of hours for some components, a few weeks for others).</p>
                        <p className='fw-bold'>I Don't Have the Right Kind of Blood  </p><span>Perhaps you’ve heard an appeal for donors that says we’re running low on certain blood types. </span>
