        question: 'How long does a blood donation take?',
        answer: 'Donating a pint of whole blood takes eight to ten minutes, while the full operation takes one hour and 15 minutes. The donors health history and blood drive participation affect the time.'

        question: 'Can donors wear a mask at a blood drive?',
        answer: 'Yes. As the country reacts to this epidemic, we must make tough choices to protect our health and safety. Infection control and safety are Red Cross priorities. The Red Cross mandates all blood donors and personnel to wear face masks during blood drives and facilities, regardless of immunization status. No valve face masks. Face masks must be worn with face shields.'

    {
        question: 'What if I become sick after donating?',
        answer: 'Donors should call our Donor Support Center at 1-866-236-3276 if they become sick with any illness in the days after their donation.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Why does the BlDonor ask so many personal questions when I give blood?',
        answer: 'Bldonor prioritizes blood supply and donate safety. Due to travel, other activities, or health issues, certain people may be at risk of transmitting infectious diseases via blood donation. We ask these questions to make sure patients and donors are safe.'
