## Acknowledgements

 - Human blood is essential. Blood oxygenates and nourishes all body parts. We created "BlDonor" to help them find and donate blood effortlessly. "BlDonor: Blood Donation Management System" is a web app for phones and other operating systems. It connects blood recipients and donors. To register, donors must provide their name, blood group, email address, password, and location. The app regularly updates donor location.
 - Thus, the system can locate registered donors everywhere. Find blood lets people look for blood donors by blood type and location. The system lists all donors with phone numbers, postal addresses, and comprehensive contact information. Our website members can access the whole application. They can donate blood, search for donors, and view donation tips (such as how to donate, who can donate, what are the benefits of donating blood, etc.) through our online payment system for the campaign. Our "Bldonor messenger" lets users contact donors to fulfill blood recipient requests. Appointments are set after donors confirm their blood donation. The web software lets registered users seek for blood donors. Our online payment system lets them donate blood. Our project simplifies emergency blood donor search.
